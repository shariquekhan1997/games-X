<h3>3. Call of Duty IV</h3>&#013;
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>After three installments set in WWII, Call of Duty 4 changes the scene and races to the 21st century to fight the war against terrorism. 
Realistic and unpredictable missions Because of the nature of war in the 21st century, you'll be faced with some high risk situations in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Prepare to encounter enemies that use surprise tactics and advanced control strategies. Luckily, you and your allies will have an arsenal full of the newest tools. New devices designed to combat the latest technologies are at your service. In Call of Duty 4, you can use infrared goggles, heat detectors or bulletproof vests of the latest generation. Add to this weapons like a long distance rifles, as powerful as a rocket launcher, and you're ready for war. 
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare offers a much more complex experience than previous version, not only because of the new weapons, but also because of some stealth operations that have to be performed in the dead of night; not only do you have to use heavy weaponery, but also silencers that help to conceal you at night. As a result, the missions have changed radically. Many of them are at night, while some require you to catch the enemy by surprise, offering some really amazing situations from the point of playability. In this sense, the different locations in places as diverse as the desert, the North Sea, and many places across the globe play an important role in the game.
Heightened control Of course, the game's controls are outstanding, and it won't be a stretch saying that accuracy is impressive. Heightened awareness makes it really easy to destroy enemies, no matter where they're coming from. 
The sound effects in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare are just as realistic. The sound of gunfire is real enough to make you tense up, and the explosions have the ability to shake the room, if you have the proper sound equipment. 
Modern Warfare: Essential Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must-play game. With simply spectacular graphics, sound and, most importantly, gameplay, Infinity Ward has changed the historical period, leaving behind World War II for a completely new expereince.

<h3> 4. City Racing </h3>&#013;
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
City Racing is a free sandbox racing game, set in and around an unnamed city. 

You begin City Racing with a wrecked car being taken to a garage, and are introduced to a mechanic who gives you a little introduction to the game. Like other sandbox racers, you can drive freely around the city, and find various events to win to increase your ranking, and win credits to upgrade your car, or buy a better one. 

Visually, City Racing is quite odd. The city is fairly generic, although it's quite big. The vehicles look vaguely futuristic, but not beautiful, and the pedestrians walking the streets are pretty outdated. The gameplay is spoiled by really wooden physics - you feel like you're driving a bumper car, and there is no real sense of speed. 

The language in the game will amuse anyone who likes bad English, as the text throughout is very badly translated. The best thing about City Racing is that it's free.
