## Contributing :inbox_tray:

Pull requests are the way to go here. We only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [flex-basis, justify-cotnent, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted classes in a [pen](http://codepen.io). That **last one is important**.
