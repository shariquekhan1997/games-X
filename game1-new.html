<h3>1. GTA IV San Andreas</h3>&#013;
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p><abbr title="Grand Theft Auto">GTA </abbr> IV San Andreas is an import mod for GTA IV, which aims to recreate the whole of San Andreas in the newer Rage engine that built IV's Liberty City. 

For GTA lovers If you're a huge fan of everything Grand Theft Auto IV, you're going to love GTA IV San Andreas. It aims to port the epic Grand Theft Auto San Andreas game to the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE). 

Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is currently the first game in the GTA series to use the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. To make GTA IV San Andreas work, you need to have Grand Theft Auto already installed on your computer. GTA IV San Andreas can be installed like any other program at that point. 

Still in Beta GTA IV San Andreas will provide access to some of the new and advanced features of the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. This includes enhanced HD graphics and sound, improved physics and also advanced replay, among other features. 

As an import mod still in beta mode, it's possible that GTA IV San Andreas will crash on occasion. A FAQ is included in a text file of the program in the event that this happens. The most common stability issues relate to saved games or GTA IV San Andreas clashing with other installed mods. 

Great boost GTA IV San Andreas is a great way to enhance graphics and other features in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

<h3>2. Counter Strike 1.6 bot</h3>&#013;
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
The solution for those that want to play Counter Strike 1.6 Counter Strike 1.6 Z-Bot, like the name indicates, lets you play against and team up with bots.
The bots are participants in a non-human game, controlled by the game's AI (Artificial Intelligence) that is. 

With this mod you will be able to carry on enjoying Counter Strike 1.6 after all the years of not being able to do so. This version, one of the classics, is obsolete.
Valve does not offer any official CS 1.6 support so it is impossible to legally play online. 
Personalize your experience Counter Strike 1.6 Z-bot includes a lot of options to personalize your bots. You can adjust the difficulty level, the weapons they have, the controls, the number of opponents... 

In fact, the biggest drawback this mod has is that its author hasn't updated it in years. Luckily, according to what we have read in discussion forums,
Counter Strike 1.6 Z-Bot doesn't have serious problems. 

No zombies or offensives: the classic lives on Counter Strike Neon Zombies, Counter Strike Source, Counter Strike Online 1 and 2, Counter Strike Global Offensive… it doesn't matter what Counters have come out these last few years: version 1.6 remains the most popular of them all.
That's why we aren't surprised that Counter Strike 1.6 has one of the most downloaded and most complete mods of the series. 
This mod does not offer the complete version of Counter Strike 1.6.
You can download the zip file for this game from the link given below.
